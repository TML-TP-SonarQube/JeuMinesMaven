# Notes
- Board Dimensions to be changed :
  - Cause : changing cell size affects the board size.
- Board Class :
  - line 81 : Use "nextInt(all_cells)" instead of position = (int) (all_cells * random.nextDouble()).
- Cell Possible Values Interpretation :
  - cell € [0,9] cell result is visible (checked) to user :
    - cell == 0 EMPTY_CELL means no mines in the 8 corners
    - cell == 9 MINE_CELL means cell has a mine
    - cell == x € [1,8] means cell has x corner cells that have mines
  - cell € [10,19] cell result invisible (non-checked) to user, but it's not marked
    - cell == 10 EMPTY_CELL means invisible empty cell 
    - cell == 19 MINE_CELL means invisible mine cell
    - cell == x € [11,18] means invisible cell that has x corner cells with a mine
  - cell € [20,29] cell result invisible (non-checked) to user, but marked by him
    - cell == 20 EMPTY_CELL means invisible marked empty cell
    - cell == 29 MINE_CELL means invisible marked mine cell
    - cell == x € [21,28] means invisible marked cell that has x corner cells with a mine

### New Model :
- Cell States :
  - Checked
  - Marked
  - Unchecked
- Corners :
  - top-left
  - top
  - top-right
  - left
  - right
  - bottom-left
  - bottom
  - bottom-right
- Cell Class :
  - int Index or ID
  - CellState state
  - boolean isCellMined
  - HashMap<Corner, Integer> Corners 
  - int cornersMineCell [0,8]
  - JLabel cellContent
  - int Width, Height
  - int row, column
  - MineTheCell()
- GameClass :
  - HashMap<Integer, Cell> gameBoard
  - bool inGame
