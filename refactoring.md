    - cell == x € [1,8] means cell has x corner cells that have mines
  - cell € [10,19] cell result invisible (non-checked) to user, but it's not marked
    - cell == 10 EMPTY_CELL means invisible empty cell 
    - cell == 19 MINE_CELL means invisible mine cell
    - cell == x € [11,18] means invisible cell that has x corner cells with a mine
  - cell € [20,29] cell result invisible (non-checked) to user, but marked by him
    - cell == 20 EMPTY_CELL means invisible marked empty cell
    - cell == 29 MINE_CELL means invisible marked mine cell
    - cell == x € [21,28] means invisible marked cell that has x corner cells with a mine
